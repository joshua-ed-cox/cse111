#Submission Comment
#For exceeding the requirements I added multiple features including:
#Defining the global variables EARTH_ACCELERATION_OF_GRAVITY, WATER_DENSITY and WATER_DYNAMIC_VISCOSITY \ 
#Then using the variables in my calculations.
#I added a function to turn kPa into psi and displayed both kPa and psi in the main function.
#I created a test function for kpa_to_psi that tests and passes a wide range of scenarios.
